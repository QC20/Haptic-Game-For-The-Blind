***Future things***

* Fix voltage problem when connecting all components 
* Make code for vibration motor work
* See if you can have it do different walls around one another to enable different vibration patterns bassed on how much the player deviates from the desired 



*** Think about things *** 

* Think about how to let the player know they won the game
* Is it possible to randomize maps? 


*** Other things to consider ***
* Come up with ideas for how to let players know if they are moving in the right direction
        ** Maybe a buzzer sound can go off with varying sound intensity based on the players x-coordinates (given they win by going left to right)
*
